The point of this recipe is to produce the reweighting ratio =  Σ w(before)/Σ w(after)
Where w(before) is the event weight with btagging weight OFF, 
      w(after) is the event weight with btagging weight ON

Note : Btag weight = Π_i(all jets) SD(jet_i)

The event weight in this case will be binned in terms of jet multiplicity (Ak4 with preselection), without any selection (inclusive analysis)

*Method* 
- Step 1 : run the Plotter (PlotterHHtobbWWDL.py) in driver mode on an analysis file containing only MC samples (aka analysis2016_MC.yml, or a specific yaml file for some samples)
    -> Step 1a : run once with `--BtagReweightingOn`
    -> Step 1b : run once with `--BtagReweightingOff`
- Step 2 : run the script `ComputeBtagReweightingRatio.py` after editing the paths at the end of the script (the histogram name should not change unless we want to bin on another variable)
- Step 3 : Put the reweighting files (in json format) in `HHbbWWAnalysis/data/ScaleFactors_Btag/`
- Step 4 : profit 

The Base class will look at the json corresponding to the name of the sample, so if you remained consistent in sample names there is nothing to change

IMPORTANT NOTES : 
- The flags `--BtagReweightingOn` and `--BtagReweightingOff` return the plots before any selection is done
    -> The lepton and jet arguments do not matter and the associated plots will not be produced !!
- As only a handful of plots will be produced, even with systematics the jobs should run quite fast
    -> In order to take advantage of that, TimeLimit of 1h (or even below) and Memory of 3000MB should be more than enough and will give more priority to the jobs
